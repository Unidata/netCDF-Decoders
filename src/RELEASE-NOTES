Release	Date		Notes
_________________	______________________________________________________
5.0.2 2013-05-07	Corrected gfs_37-44.cdl (grids are 1.25x1.25 degree);
                        added ukmet_21-24.cdl (like GFS AVN, these are 1.25x1.25 degree
                        grids); added '-n' flag to gribtonc (says to not expand
                        the record dimension past what is defined in the CDL/existing
                        netCDF file); updated 'port' subdirectory with latest code
                        (so that the package will build on CentOS 6.4 x86_64)
5.0.1 2012-06-13	Remade ruc2_236.cdl because of transfer of the RUC2 production
			from FSL to RAP 
5.0.0 2007-10-10	The perl Decoders have been moved to their own package
			so the process of deprecating this package can take place.
			This package is being deprecated because of it's 
			limitation of not being able to decode Grib2, compile
			problems, and static parameter table.

                        ascii2nc.1 for perl decoder ascii2nc
                        In metar2nc, syn2nc, bouy2nc and ua2nc changed
                        RDWR typeglob to WRITE because not exported any 
                        longer in netcdf-perl

2.3.2  1996-11-14	Release tar file was corrupted.
2.3.1  1996-11-08	Fixes by Harry Edmon, for the edition 0 grids.

2.3.0  1996-10-22	First release of the combined gribtonc and perl decoders
			For gribtonc, same as release 2.2.2 .  For perl decoders,
			a new Synoptic decoder and improved Buoy decoder that
			decodes the BBXX reports as well as the ZZYY reports.
			Other minor fixes.

2.2.2  1996-06-18	Fixed small memory leak in gribtonc that occurred
			when short or oversize product is abandoned. 

			Changed gribdump/gribtonc scan so that anything can
			occur after terminating '7777', not just <CR><CR>
			or 'GRIB', by checking count after 'GRIB'.  This
			will make gribtonc work for GRIB products that are
			separated by arbitrary stuff, not just WMO
			envelopes.

			Updated to incorporate January 2, 1996 changes to
			NCEP Office Note 388 (GRIB Edition 1).

2.2.1  1996-01-10	Fixed cause of segmentation violation or
			"out of memory" message that might occur if gribtonc
			has timed out from not receiving input for ten
			minutes, and a new gribtonc needs to open the same
			output file to append more data.

			Fixed declaration in ulog.c that prevented it from
			compiling with non-standard /usr/ucb/cc compiler.

			Including sample pqact.conf entries for HDS data in
			gribtonc/cdl/hds.conf.  Updated cdl README file.

2.2    1996-01-05	Isolated code to handle (reftimes,valtimes)-> record
			mapping.  Fixed getrec() function to not re-write
			reftimes and valtimes variables when opening an
			existing netCDF file.  Corrected handling of units
			for valtime and reftime (valtime was in seconds
			rather than hours).

			Write datetime and valtime_offset variables, if
			present, to aid human comprehension.

			Write extra time-range indicator information with
			auxilliary variables, such as PRECIP_accum_times for
			precipitation accumulation intervals.

			Added ncsync() after writing each product, to keep
			netCDF file updated.

			Changed longitude in navigation for G grid to -52.5
			(was 52.5).

			Updated old Copyright notices.

			Added erealloc and used for growing tables.

			Added datetime and valtime_offset variables to CDL
			files to aid human comprehension of reference times
			and forecast times.

			Added "accum" dimension and extra auxilliary
			precipitation variables to CDL files for
			precipitation accumulation intervals, where needed.

			Removed some gratuitous differences in
			capitalization in values of long_name attributes in
			CDL files.
			
			Updated ECMF model ID to 132 in ecmf.cdl.

			Changed "NMC" references to "NCEP" and "HRS"
			occurrences to "HDS" in CDL files.


2.1    1995-12-12	Adapted to new ETA model parameters and levels.
			
			Base level tables on level dimensions rather than
			type of level (and similarly for layers).  This
			permits multiple level tables for the same kind of
			level, which allows multiple level dimensions of the
			same kind.  The new ETA model uses five different
			sigma layer dimensions, so this was necessary.  The
			ability to have multiple level dimensions was
			exploited in changes to the CDL templates for the
			ETA, NGM, and AVN models, to make the resulting
			netCDF files smaller by eliminating levels and
			layers that don't exist for some variables.

			Removed the ill-conceived "accum" dimension used for
			precipitation accumulation, and the whole idea of
			using a dimension for time range indicators.  This
			also reduces the size of netCDF files that used it.

			Permit non-record variables, such as Z_sfc(y,x) for
			terrain.

			Added new parameters: helicity, u and components of
			storm motion.

			Fixed gribdump and gribtonc to read raw GRIB
			products as well as GRIB products in a WMO envelope.

			Added portential vorticity level.

			Changed sigma levels units to be dimensionsless.

			Added netCDF file name to messages printed when no
			parameter match found.

			Added parameter 10 for total ozone.

			Added new time units for 3, 6, 12 hours and new time
			range indicators for variance and standard
			deviation.

			Added new level dimensions to CDL template files for
			the subset of isobaric levels on which absolute
			vorticity and relative humidity are computed.

			Eliminated use of grep(1)'s -q option in configure
			script because it's not supported on all platforms.

2.0.11 1995-11-27	Reverted lifted index parameters from degC to degK, 
			because they are really degK, this is not an
			artifact of units conversion.

			Removed the LI:level_1 and LI:level_2 attributes
			from ngm-g.cdl and ngm-q.cdl, because the lifted
			index levels are specified as values for the
			liso_bot and liso_top variables.

2.0.10 1995-11-22	Allow psuedo-units like "(allocated by centers)"
			that begin with a "(", so that adding new data to
			existing netCDF files created with the old .cdl
			files will work without generating lots of error
			messages about error parsing units. 
			
2.0.9 1995-11-22	Fixed handling of levels and layers units.  For
			example, liso layers use kPa in GRIB product, but
			should be changed to hPa in netCDF file.

			Fixed lifted index units to be C instead of K, since
			the lifted index is a difference of temperatures.
			Fixed sigma level units to be dimensionless.

			Removed silly "(allocated by centers)" unit
			attribute for model_id variable, so now all CDL file
			units are parsable by udunits.

			Changed FILENAME_MAX to _POSIX_PATH_MAX to
			workaround incorrect HP definition of former
			constant.

			Changed liso dimension from 2 to 1 in CDL files,
			because there is only one lifted index for these
			parameters.  Also changed liso_top and liso_bot to
			500 and 1000 to use hPa.
			
2.0.8 1995-11-17	Generalized handling of levels and layers to handle
			all GRIB levels and layers, not just those currently
			in HDS datastream.  Added conventional names for new
			level and layer dimensions.

			Added Z_sfc parameter to ruc.cdl and ngm-q.cdl,
			since it's now appeaaring in the HDS datastream.

2.0.7 1995-11-03	Add model 81 (SSIAVN) to allowable model_id values
			for avn_q.cdl.  Add P_sfc variable to RUC model
			variables.

			Rename "gribtonc/test/" directory to
			"gribtonc/tests" so "make test" has a chance of
			working.

			Fixed portability problems so would compile on AIX
			and Ultrix, making sure "c89" compiler is preferred
			to "cc" on AIX.

			Got "make test" to work on OSF1-3.0, AIX-4.1,
			HPUX-9.05, IRIX-5.3, SunOS-5.4, SunOS-4.1.4, and
			Ultrix 4.4.
			
2.0.6 1995-10-31	In cdl/avn-q.cdl, deleted "liso" dimension and
			changed LI not to use liso dimension, since the
			model output now says lifted index is defined for
			LEVEL_SURFACE, not for LEVEL_LISO as it used to be.
			Changed accumulation intervals used for PRECIP
			variable to match what is now appearing in the data
			stream.
			
			Fixed format descriptors in some error messages in
			gribdump and gribtonc to match type of value
			printed.  This fixes a segmentation violation
			occurring in gribtonc when preciptaion intervals
			don't match CDL file for AVN model.

2.0.5	1995-10-25	Fixed repeated 180,-180 longitude in avn-x.cdl.

2.0.4	1995-10-11	Corrected eta.cdl to provide model_id dimension.

2.0.3	1995-10-11	Added new ETA 48km model number.

			Ported makefiles to POSIX standard.

2.0.2	1995-6-19

			removed alloca() from port for HP-UX fix

			fixed cubic spline interpolation in gribtonc

			modified gribdump to print data by row

2.0.1	1995-6-15

			Initial beta release
