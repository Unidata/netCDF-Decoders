This directory contains CDL files for netCDF files of decoded HDS grid
data.  CDL files are ASCII representations for netCDF files.  The `ncgen'
utility can be used to convert a CDL file into a netCDF file, and the
`ncdump' utility can be used to convert a netCDF file into a CDL file.  The
*.cdl files in this directory are used by the `gribtonc' decoder in creating
netCDF files from the HDS GRIB data.

If you will be having the ldm server invoke `gribtonc' to decode GRIB data
into netCDF files, it would be convenient to install these files in the
`etc/' subdirectory of the ldm server's default directory, for example
`/usr/local/ldm/etc'.  That way you may provide `gribtonc' with short
relative pathnames rather than long absolute pathnames for the CDL files.
Here is an example of a pqact.conf entry for the RUC model data, assuming
you install ruc.cdl in the ldm/etc directory:

# RUC model on Lambert conformal CONUS grid
HDS	^[YZ].Q... KWBC (..)(..).*/mRUC
	PIPE	/usr/local/ldm/decoders/gribtonc
	etc/ruc_211.cdl
	data/GRIB/(\1:yy)(\1:mm)\1\2_ruc_211.nc

A complete set of example pqact.conf entries using these CDL files is in 
the gribtonc.entries file in this directory.

NUWG Conventions
================

These CDL files use the NUWG conventions for representing georeferencing
information for gridded files.  For more information about NUWG conventions,

Useful Changes to CDL Files
===========================

The netCDF files produced by `gribtonc' can be changed by editing these CDL
files.  The kinds of changes you might want to make to the HDS CDL files
include changes to the `units' attribute, deletion of some variables or
levels to save space, and combining parameters from separate CDL files into
the same CDL file.

Currently GRIB edition 1 units are used but for historical continuity with
archives, you may want to convert to GRIB edition 0 units, as in previous
releases.  You can change the units to any conformable units, and the
`gribtonc' decoder will convert from GRIB edition 1 units to the specified
units as part of the decoding.  The syntax for units are as specified for
the `udunits' library, installation of which is a prerequisite for
`gribtonc'.

You may omit some of the level values in the data section of a CDL file that
includes a level dimension, reducing the size of the resulting file
proportionally, since GRIB products for the omitted levels won't be stored.

Time Dimension
--------------

The NUWG has agreed that there should only be one record dimension,
`record', with the model reference time, `reftime(record)' and the forecast
time, `valtime(record)', both doubles in units of `hours since 1992-1-1'.
This has the advantage over the old `frtime' unlimited dimension that
multiple model runs may be stored in the same file.  The provided CDL files
also contain variables `datetime' and `valtime_offset', which gribtonc will
fill in with the derived reference date and time and period from reference
time, respectively.

Dimension Attributes
--------------------

There is already a convention for a variable that has the same name as a
dimension.  Such a variable is called a coordinate variable, and is expected
to be a one-dimensional vector that has coordinate values for the associated
dimension.  The NUWG has agreed on another convention for attributes that
have the same name as dimensions.  Such an attribute is called a "dimension
attribute".  It is a string-valued attribute that names one or more
variables that together constitute a "key" for that dimension.  Each such
variable must be a vector that uses only the dimension for its shape.  For a
list of variables to be a key for a dimension means that given values for
the named variables, at most one dimension value is functionally determined
by these values.  Examples of dimension attributes in the CDL files for HDS
data include the global `record' attribute and attributes for level and
layer dimensions such as `ls', `ls_sfc', `lfhg', `lpdg', etc.

Other Changes
-------------

The NUWG has also recommended use of a navigation dimension to describe both
the lat/lon grids as well as polar-stereographic, Lambert conformal,
quasi-regular and other grids that may appear on the HDS circuit.
Navigation (or georeferencing) information, is what's needed to transform
from the indices of a variable (indicial space) to a location (lat/lon
space).

Hence instead of simply using a list of latitudes and a list of longitudes
for a latitude/longitude grid, a separate `navigation dimension' is employed
for each navigation mapping needed in a netCDF file.  Variables that use the
navigation dimension provide the parameters of the mapping.  Where standard
names for variables describing a navigation mapping are needed, NUWG chose
to adopt the names used in the Stackpole document describing GRIB edition 1.
Use of navigation dimensions are provided in all of the CDL files.
