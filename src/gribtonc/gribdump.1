.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
This program decodes GRIB products (embedded in WMO product envelopes) on
the NWS High-Resolution Data Service (HRS) feed, writing textual
representations of the products or summaries of the products to standard
output.
.SH OPTIONS 
.TP
.B \-h
Headers only.  Information from the Product Description Section and Grid
Description Section is output, but no data values are output.  The default
is to output both headers and data values.
.TP
.B \-b
Brief output.  Only one line is output for each product, providing summary
information of the parameter, grid, model, levels, time ranges, and other
information.
.TP
.BI \-p " precision"
Precision used for printing floating-point values, if other than the
7-significant figure default is desired.
.TP
.BI \-e " errpath"
If a GRIB product cannot be decoded, perhaps because it is truncated or
otherwise corrupted, it is appended to this file.

.TP
.BI \-g " tabfile"
Use GRIB-netcdf translation defined in this file. The format of this file
is:
.LP
.LP
.nf
Grib;netCDF;long name               ;units;comments
 31 ;CI    ;Sea-ice cover           ;none ;(0-1)
 34 ;SSTK  ;Sea surface temperature ;K    ;
151 ;MSL   ;Mean sea-level pressure ;Pa   ;
167 ;T2M   ;2 metre temperature     ;K    ;
.fi
.RE
.TP
.BI \-q " qspecs"
Specification for how to expand so-called quasi-regular or thinned grids
into rectangular grids.  This argument is a
comma-delimited text string that specifies the method of interpolation used
(currently \fBlin\fP for linear or \fBcub\fP for cubic), and the latitude
and longitude
increments in degrees for the resulting grid (e.g. \fBdlat=2.5,dlon=5.0\fP).
.TP
.I files
The path name of one or more files of GRIB products used as input.
If no filenames are provided, GRIB products are read from standard input.
.SH EXAMPLE
The command
.RS +4
.nf
gribdump -q "lin,dlat=2.5,dlon=5.0" avn-x.wmo
.fi
.RE
will decode and display values for the products in avn-x.wmo If the data
contain quasi-regular grids, they will be expanded to full regular grids on
a 2.5 by 5.0 degree grid before being written into the output file.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
Error messages and log messages are written to the log file.
