# This file is for customizing the configuation process performed by
# `./configuration'.  This file consists of sh(1) variable-definition lines.
# The value given to those variable by this file will override their default
# values.
#
# You can also customize the configuration process via the environment
# variables seen by ./configure.  For example:
#
#     In csh(1):
#	  % setenv CC acc
#	  & setenv CFLAGS -g
#	  % ./configure
#
#     In sh(1):
#	  $ CC=acc CFLAGS=-g ./configure
#
# Variables in this file override the environmental ones. All the paths in
# this file are examples, set the paths to your installation paths

# Here are sample setting for environment variables: CPP_NETCDF, LD_NETCDF,
# CPP_UDUNITS, LD_UDUNITS, and UDUNITS_PATH.  The packages udunits and netCDF
# must be installed to set these variables. The INSTALL file has more detail.
# The current setting will not work except for the CC variable, that I would
# leave set as is.
#
#
# netCDF header file and library references:
#CPP_NETCDF=/home/rkambic/netcdf/include
#LD_NETCDF='-L/home/rkambic/netcdf/lib -lnetcdf'
#
# udunits header file and library references:
#CPP_UDUNITS=-I/home/rkambic/udunits/include
#LD_UDUNITS='-L/home/rkambic/udunits/lib -ludunits'

# On Linux and BSD systems:

# Type of C compiler:
CC=gcc
#
# Installation prefix:
# prefix=/usr/local/unidata
#
# udunits.dat file location, set UDUNITS_PATH so runtime gribtonc can find file
#UDUNITS_PATH=/home/rkambic/udunits/etc/udunits.dat
